# Network Programming

This project contains 4 homework assignments in Network Programming course (graduate-level in NCTU). There are spec, source code, and test data in each assignment.

Project 1: a rsh-like shell called Remote Access System ([RAS](np1-ras/spec/hw1Spec.txt)).

Project 2: a chat-like system called Remote Working System ([RWS](np2-rwg/spec/hw2.txt)).

Project 3: a remote batch system ([RBS](np3-rbs/spec/hw3_spec.txt)) in HTTP.

Project 4: a [sock (proxy) server](np4-sock/spec/NP_project4.pptx) which should support sock4 protocol.

The projects were asked to be written in C/C++, to make code clean, some C++11 syntax sugers are used.

The code isn't written for optimizing performance but for proof-of-concepts.
